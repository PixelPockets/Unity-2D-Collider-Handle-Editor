These files allow you to edit the scale of Unity's 2D collider handles.  
 
NOTE: Using these files will remove Unity's default 2D collider editing toggle. 

**WARNING: THIS HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED WITH UNITY VERSION 2022.3.53f.**

How to use - 

1) Place these files in an "Editor" folder. Make sure to include ColliderEditModeManager. This file is necessary for this to function.
2) Click on the "Edit Collider Handles" checkbox to edit the scale of any 2D collider handle, including Unity's 2D composite collider
3) Choose the color of the collider handles by clicking on the "Handle Color" box.
4) Choose which handle shape you'd like to use by clicking on the "Handle Shape" dropdown menu. 

2D composite collider editor interface - 

**Note: With the composite collider, the handle editing applies to ALL 2D colliders within that composite collider.**

**UPDATE - You can now keep the scale of the handles consistent when zooming in and out in scene view, if you prefer this behavior.**
